### LEARNINGS
<font color="#000000"><center><span style="background:#d3f8b6">(RULES that need to be drummed into your head as default codes) -</span></center></font>
- (EXAMPLE) Hey Varun, you have a habit of going down rabbit holes when it comes to learning new thing, although it's a good thing, it ends up wasting a lot of your time. Just be aware of this when you're spending too much time on something when it's not really needed.
- #### Always start with your name. (Hey, "XYZ")
---
<center><span style="background:#ff4d4f"><font color="#000000">Whenever in doubt -</font></span></center>

- (EXAMPLE) Varun, If you think that spending time researching will help you, just do one of these things, Create a note about it, and add all the links and add your thoughts as to why you need to spend time on it. Then comeback after a few days and see if you still find it really necessary to research on that topic.
---

### DATA DROP
- (EXAMPLE) Varun, Whenever you visit YouTube, you end up wasting a lot of time there which messes up your rhythm for the rest of the day. Just be careful when you're visiting YouTube.
---

### SPECIFIC
- (EXAMPLE) Hey Varun, you hate meeting X, he is very annoying and egotistical person(at least towards you). Just avoid this person all together. Even though you meet him because he asks you, the whole meeting just annoys you and ends up making you frustrated.

# üóíÔ∏è Today's Summary
* I set a PR today by dead lifting mount Everest, I think I can do more today
* After finishing the parallel dimensinator, it's time to test it today, All calculations say we can successfully visit Earth 42,644
* I'd thought that making that brainwashing machine was a waste of time, guess I was wrong, might have to use it tomorrow on some pretty bad aliens, who thought they could just destroy earth for fun
